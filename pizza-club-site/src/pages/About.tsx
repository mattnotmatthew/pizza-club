                The Greater Chicagoland Pizza Club has become a disrupter in the
                pizza club landscape. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Founded in 2013, our club began with a
                single yet powerful belief: the world doesn't need more of the
                same; it needs revolutions. Our club members are revolutionaries
                who challenge the pizza dining status quo. The taverns are the
                stages in which each member challenges the ordinary by demanding
                the extraordinaryâ€”one square slice at a time.
              </p>
              <p>For our members,
                pizza isn't just a way to meet our nourishment needs. It serves
                a greater purpose, one of the shared human experience. The
                Greater Chicagoland Pizza Club offers the opportunity to share
                in the complexities of our collective human journey. It is a
                place where we can come together, regardless of our dietary
                differences, and celebrate the cheese that binds us all
                together
