## Q1: Will users be able to create accounts and log in to the pizza club website?
**Answer:** No - Not at this time. Membership is extremely small, around 7-8 members.

## Q2: Should the website display real-time or near real-time updates when new ratings or visits are added?
**Answer:** No - But at some point we'll need the ability to allow users to visualize rating data or compare places the club has visited.

## Q3: Will the pizza club need to manage events or scheduled visits to pizza restaurants?
**Answer:** Partial Yes - I would like to be able to easily add upcoming events and display them on the page for those curious. And I would like to do so without having to push a new build of the site out. Re: scheduling - that is not necessary at this juncture.

## Q4: Should members be able to upload photos of their pizza experiences?
**Answer:** No - Not at this time.

## Q5: Will the website need to integrate with any external services (maps, social media, payment systems)?
**Answer:** Yes
