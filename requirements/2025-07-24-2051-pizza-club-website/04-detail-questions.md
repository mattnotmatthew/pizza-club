# Expert Detail Questions

## Q6: Should the events management system use a lightweight headless CMS (like Strapi/Sanity) or would a simpler solution like a JSON file in a public GitHub repo suffice for your needs?
**Default if unknown:** Yes to headless CMS (provides better user experience for non-technical users adding events)

## Q7: For the map integration showing pizza restaurants, should clicking on a restaurant marker display the club's average rating and latest visit date in a popup?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (provides immediate value to users exploring the map)

## Q8: Should the restaurant ratings use a standardized scale (like 1-10 or 1-5 stars) that all members must follow?
**Default if unknown:** Yes, use 1-5 stars (familiar pattern that's easy to aggregate and visualize)

## Q9: When displaying members on the site, should each member have their own profile page with their individual pizza ratings and visit history?
**Default if unknown:** No (keep it simple with just a members list/grid for now)

## Q10: For the future data visualization feature, should the system track individual member ratings separately to enable comparisons like "Member A vs Member B pizza preferences"?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (storing granular data now enables richer features later)
