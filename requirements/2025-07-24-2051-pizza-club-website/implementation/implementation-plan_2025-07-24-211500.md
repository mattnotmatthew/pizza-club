   - `@vis.gl/react-google-maps` for maps
   - `axios` or `fetch` wrapper for API calls
   - Development tools: `@types/react-router-dom`, `prettier`, `eslint`

4. Create project structure as specified:
   ```
   src/

- Browser testing (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge)
- Lighthouse audits for performance/accessibility
- API integration testing
- Maps functionality across different locations

## Validation Against Acceptance Criteria
- ✓ Mobile-responsive: Tailwind utilities ensure all breakpoints covered
- ✓ Dynamic events: CMS integration allows non-technical updates
- ✓ Member profiles: All members have dedicated pages
- ✓ Restaurant map: Interactive with ratings and visit data
- ✓ 5-star ratings: Standardized display across site
- ✓ Smooth navigation: React Router with lazy loading
- ✓ Cross-browser: Modern build tools ensure compatibility

## Mobile-First Design Principles
1. **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44x44px for all interactive elements
2. **Typography**: Base 16px, scaling for readability
3. **Spacing**: Generous padding for thumb reach
4. **Navigation**: Bottom-friendly for one-handed use
5. **Performance**: <3s load time on 3G networks
6. **Offline**: Basic functionality without connection
