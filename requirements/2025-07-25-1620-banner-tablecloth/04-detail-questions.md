# Expert Requirements Questions

Now that I understand the codebase structure, here are detailed implementation questions:

## Q6: Should text remain directly on the checkered pattern or have a semi-transparent overlay for better readability?
**Default if unknown:** Yes, add overlay (ensures text remains readable against busy pattern)

## Q7: Should the checkered squares be exactly 45-degree rotated (diamond) or straight grid aligned?
**Default if unknown:** No, straight grid (traditional tablecloth style, easier to implement)

## Q8: Should the pattern extend edge-to-edge or have padding/borders around it?
**Default if unknown:** Yes, edge-to-edge (maximizes visual impact of the pattern)

## Q9: Should we use the exact same red shade (#b91c1c from red-700) as currently used?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (maintains brand consistency)

## Q10: Should the pattern be implemented as a reusable CSS class that could be applied to other elements in the future?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (follows DRY principles and allows for future reuse)
